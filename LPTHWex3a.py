# Exercise 3a gives instruction on mathematical operations, order of operation, and the modulus
print "I will now count my chickens:"
#initial exercise concantenating string with int types
print "Hens", 25 + 30 / 6
# first useage of modulus
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

print "Now I will count the eggs:"
#demonstrates order of operations (PEMDAS)
print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6
# Boolean logic test, but how, data appears to be type string
print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7
# or is it the return of line fourteen, lets add a new line and find out (see line 26)
# Break down of operations
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2
print "What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7

print "Oh, that's why it's False."

print "How about some more."

print "Is it greater", 5 > - 2
print "Is it geater or equal?", 5 >= -2
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2
print "Lets see if the new line worked as expected"
print 5 + 7 != 6 + 4
